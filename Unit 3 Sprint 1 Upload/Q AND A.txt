What, in your opinion, is an important part
 of code reviews? That is, what is something
 you pay attention to when you review code,
 and that you appreciate when others do the
 same for your code?

A major part of code reviews is the fact that
 without a second pair of eyes looking at 
 your code, you won't be able to truly know
 if what you composed was intelligible or not.
 Essentially, the work needs to be looked at
 or else you run the risk of having created
 a 'black box' where a person can run your 
 code but may not be able to make much sense 
 of it. Every written language is meant as a 
 form of communication. If you are unable to 
 communicate properly, the result is almost
 always a negative one. E.G. having the 
 answers to the universe but being unable to
 communicate it to someone else means you have
 no bearing on if you are correct or not.
 No independent source of validation.

Containers are almost like chapter headings
 in a book. Sure, there are many many layers
 and details within a book BUT those details 
 will be unintelligible if we need to think 
 of each detail in its own singular form.
 Grouping things together assists in the
 natural human memory recall process by 
 limiting the number of components to recall.
 This is also why we use bins for charts
 and why the natural human tendency to
 stereotype occurs. Fun fact: humans are only
 able to have ~150 meaningful relationship of
 which they can keep track of said relationship's
 details.
